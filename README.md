Interactive tool for diagnosing common failures of hydraulic pumps and estimating repair costs in Belarus.

## Features
- Symptom-based diagnosis (oil leak, noise, pressure loss, overheating, metal debris)
- Cost estimation adjusted by pump brand tier:
  - Domestic (PSM, GST, MAZ)
  - Mid-range import (Bosch Rexroth, Sauer, Eaton)
  - Heavy-duty import (Kawasaki, Linde, Hitachi)
- Real-time calculation with engineering-grade logic

## How it works
The calculator uses a rule-based engine to match symptoms with typical failure modes and applies regional pricing coefficients for Belarus.
